    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Online security is important, it aims to secure your website against possible intruders. 

        Typical scenarios could be that the user experiences identity fraud or financial fraud. These scenarios are most often not aware of by the user, and this is where a front-end developer must ensure that these scenarios do not occur.
        
        By securing a potential customers website, I will make the customer aware of the three types of online security threats that one should be aware of. These include Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and Cross-site request forgery.
        There are different methods to use, including Sanitization of data, secure authorization and authentication, third-party application, continuous deployment/continuous integration (CI/CD), network security, and implementation of automatic user timeout.
        
        Sanitization of data: Ensures that the data a system accepts is in the correct format. By using NodeJS you can clean up your HTML code.
        
        Secure authorization and authentication: An open standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin or Okta ensures that authorization and authentication are difficult to crack.

        Third-Party Application: Ensure that a third-party application is trusted and tested.
        
        CI/CD: This is to be able to integrate and deliver code to production through an automatic process. If the developer has overlooked something, this catches this and maintains reliability.
        
        Network security: A front-end developer must keep track of which network to connect to and be aware of where the website will be hosted.
        
        Implementation of automatic user timeout: For those users who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time, it is important to ensure that this is protected by ensuring that the API you use has taken this into account.
